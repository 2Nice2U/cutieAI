# Cutie AI
CutieAI is the backend to Heart[bot] it is an A.I. project done by a few DARPA/IIRA staff, technical Minecraft players, and other mod developers in collaboration with Anonymous, illuminati & the deep state. She was originally intended for military training, but the team modified cutieAI to be compatible with discord. So technically, current Heart[bot] is Heart[bot] 2.0. (Well, 2.3 to be exact.)

Heart[bot] is taught using millions of messages present in the discord servers she's in and uses a special search algorithm similar to that of a search engine to find the appropriate result from the servers and the secret Heart[bot]-team-only discord server. Then Heart[bot] makes a sensible response using the search result and the message patterns.

Project Heart[bot] took 3 years and 5 months before the A.I. became functional. Heart[bot] 1.0, which is for military use, came out on 07/26/2016. Heart[bot] 2.0, which is for discord, came out on 05/10/2017.

Heart[bot] is just a part of an even bigger project, however. The ultimate goal of the team is to create a perfect Minecraft player, an A.I. that plays Minecraft. You can find more information about it in the secret society of the lizard people. That project has the codename "project Grohiik", this is currently in early development and the AI seems to have a much higher affinity for removing blocks rather than placing them.

The team created an A.I. for programming and debugging assistance more sophisticated than current ones out there. But that was just phase 1. In phase 2, the team upgraded cutieAI to make her able to program by herself.

So next time you see Heart[bot], talk to her. It will provide a great learning opportunity for Heart[bot] to become even more human-like.
